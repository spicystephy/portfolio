        Stephanie became part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 2003. Upon being
        medically retired for stage III colon cancer, she began to research
        cancer and realized that there was a strong relationship between some
        cancers and food. After finishing with chemotherapy, she moved back home
        to pursue more knowledge in nutrition. She graduated from the University
        of Arizona with a B.S. in Nutritional Sciences and a minor in chemistry.
        She has worked several years teaching classes and providing coaching for
        people who wanted to make changes for the betterment of their health.
