            I joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 2003. Upon being
            medically retired for stage III colon cancer, I began to research
            cancer and realized that there was a strong relationship between
            some cancers and food. After finishing with chemotherapy, I moved
            back home to pursue more knowledge in nutrition. I graduated from
            the University of Arizona with a B.S. in Nutritional Sciences and a
            minor in chemistry. I has worked several years teaching classes
            and providing coaching for people who wanted to make changes for the
            betterment of their health.
