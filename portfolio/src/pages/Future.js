        Totonki Tortilla Warmers is a one-of-a-kind shop built by my mom. She
        has been selling her homemade tortilla warmers on Etsy and local craft
        fairs. I would love for her to have her very own site.

        Delilah's Delights will be a site for a friend to sell her macarons.
        Currently she sells through Instagram and would like a proper store
        front of her own.

        Granillo & Co. will be a site built for a friend so that she can start
        her own businness as a private therapist.

        Finally, Rate that Restroom is an idea I had many, many years ago.
        Because of my health issues, I often found myself urgently needing a
        restroom. There were some that were great for noise suppression and
        ventillation, and some that left me feeling embarrased. However, I
        noticed that a lot these restrooms were not what they seemed on the
        outside. Thus, I thought it would be great for people to give a rating
        to a public restroom they visited to inform future pit=stoppers of what
        to expect.

        *Update:* Rate that Restroom has been created and is called Bathroom
        Buddy. This project has 3 collaborators; myself, [Brett
        Freeman](https://github.com/bhfreeman), and [Sarah
        Bonnell](https://github.com/sarahbinaz1020). Find it on my site!
